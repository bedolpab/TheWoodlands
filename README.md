# TheWoodlands
"The Woodlands: Nuclear Winter" is a post-apocalyptic, WPF, 2D object-oriented programming game using C# and XAML. It was a final project developed for my *PROG 101 "Introduction to Programming"* course at *Columbia College Chicago*. The summary of the game goes:
>After a series of events between powerful nations, war broke out. Weapons of mass destruction (WMD) were used, and many died. Luckily, your current location was not a target. Unfortunately, nuclear winter awaits, and you must prepare. Gather supplies to survive.

Players are able to collect items at any of the 5 locations *if* they contain items. When items are collected, players are able to view their items in their inventory. Locations with NPCs may also contain items that players can collect by trading them.
